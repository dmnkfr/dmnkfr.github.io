### Experience
__Aug 2021 Data Science Fellow at Science to Data Science__

[Science to Data Science (S2DS)](https://s2ds.org/) is a highly selective and intensive 5-week program with the aim of facilitating academics to transition into data science.

During the program, I worked in a team of five on a project commissioned by the [Food Standards Agency (FSA)](https://www.food.gov.uk/) on assessing the usefulness of social media to understand changes in behaviors and attitudes towards food during the 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the project was to identify the main themes and trends of conversations on social media around food and COVID-19. 

- Assessed the usefulness of social media data to understand changes in peopleâ€™s behaviours and attitudes towards food-related topics
- Distilled main trends from the data using NLP and machine learning methods on AWS
- Successfully delivered a proof-of-concept that social media listening can be reliably used to observe consumer behaviours in almost real-time
- Communicated insights to a diverse audience through story telling and visualisations


__2018-2021 Postdoctoral Researcher at Stockholm University__

- Designed and managed large-scale experiments on second language processing and representation in the brain
- Published an article in the top journal in the field, [ _Applied Linguistics_ ](https://academic.oup.com/applij)

- Organised and chaired regular lab meetings

__2017-2018 Postdoctoral Researcher at BIFIE (now IQS) Austria__

- Designed, developed, and validated a UX-supported [language assessment and training tool for children](https://usbplus.at/), in close collaboration with highly heterogeneous stakeholders
