### Experience
__Since Feb 2022:__ ___Data Scientist at Kidzabout___
- Unit testing, completing, and extending of existing code base.
- Researching and collecting additional data sets, and adding support within the custom environment.
- Basic data exploration and development of baseline models to evaluate data quality.
- Expanding support for Text-Document-Representations.



__Aug 2021:__ ___Data Science Fellow at Science to Data Science___

[Science to Data Science (S2DS)](https://s2ds.org/) is a highly selective and intensive 5-week program with the aim of facilitating academics to transition into data science.

During the program, I worked in a team of five on a project commissioned by the [Food Standards Agency (FSA)](https://www.food.gov.uk/) on assessing the usefulness of social media to understand changes in behaviors and attitudes towards food during the 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the project was to identify the main themes and trends of conversations on social media around food and COVID-19. 

- Assessed the usefulness of social media data to understand changes in peopleâ€™s behaviours and attitudes towards food-related topics
- Distilled main trends from the data using NLP and machine learning methods on AWS
- Successfully delivered a proof-of-concept that social media listening can be reliably used to observe consumer behaviours in almost real-time
- Communicated insights to a diverse audience through story telling and visualisations


__2018-2021:__ ___Postdoctoral Researcher at Stockholm University___

- Designed and managed large-scale experiments on second language processing and representation in the brain
- Published an article in the top journal in the field, [ _Applied Linguistics_ ](https://academic.oup.com/applij)
- Designed and implemented an R pipeline to process, analyse, and visualise electrical brain activation and behavioural data
- Organised and chaired regular lab meetings

__2017-2018:__ ___Postdoctoral Researcher at BIFIE (now IQS) Austria___

- Designed, developed, and validated a UX-supported [language assessment and training tool for children](https://usbplus.at/), in close collaboration with highly heterogeneous stakeholders
- Successfully rolled out this tool, which is now used by thousands of teachers in Austria
- Organised and held seminars on linguistics, language development, and language assessment for hundreds of teachers, principals, and language therapists across Austria

__2016-2017:__ ___Lecturer (part-time) at University of Salzburg___

Teaching undergraduate and graduate courses on experimental methods in linguistics and on the neurolinguistic foundations of second language acquisition.

__2014/2015:__ ___Visiting Postgraduate Researcher at University of Edinburgh___

Collaboration in an experiment on incremental language comprehension in a thriving lab environment.

__2011-2015:__ ___Doctoral Researcher at University of Salzburg___

Conceptualization, design, implementation, conduction, analysis, and write-up of a number of electrophysiological and behavioural experiments on predictive and semantic sentence processing in a first and second language.
