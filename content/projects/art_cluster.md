### Using K-Means Clustering to Quantise Art

Here's a fun little project in which I used k-means clustering to fill a painting by Austrian artist [Jonas Geise](https://www.galerievonier.com/artists/jonas-geise/) with the ten dominant colors of another one of his paintings.

Find the Jupyter notebook [here.](https://github.com/dmnkfr/art_cluster/blob/main/art_cluster.ipynb)
