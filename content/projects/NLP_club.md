### Weekly NLP study and hands-on work group.

Since September 2022 I am leading a __weekly study group on NLP__. Through this, we gain hands-on experience with a variety of NLP-related tasks, such as experimenting with different vectorizations and transformations, feature extraction, text classification, topic modeling, and getting familiar with the most common frameworks and APIs, such as __scikit-learn, tensorflow, spaCy, NLTK, and huggingface__.

For instance, we showed that __simple models can outperform neural nets__ in sentiment classification ([notebook](https://github.com/dmnkfr/NLP-Era/blob/main/spotify_review_project/notebooks/sklearn_pipeline.ipynb), [kaggle contribution](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dominikfreunberger/simpler-is-better-sentiment-classification)), and used both classic LDA ([notebook](https://github.com/dmnkfr/NLP-Era/blob/main/spotify_review_project/notebooks/LDA_topic_modeling.ipynb)) and the amazing BERTopic ([notebook](https://github.com/dmnkfr/NLP-Era/blob/main/spotify_review_project/notebooks/BERT_topic_modeling.ipynb)) for __(dynamic) topic modeling.__ Currently, we are prototyping a web-based __text analysis application__ for internal use that will support analysts in gaining insight from open text answers in surveys.
