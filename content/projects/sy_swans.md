### Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning with song lyrics

In this project, I am exploring the lyrics of the NY noise rock bands Swans and Sonic Youth using __NLP and machine learning methods__.

- The __code__ for this project is [here](https://github.com/dmnkfr/sonic_youth/blob/main/sy_swans.Rmd).

- The __rendered site__ without the code is [here](https://dmnkfr.github.io/sonic_youth/).

- The __app__ that tells you whether your own text sounds more like Swans or Sonic Youth is [here](https://dmnkfr.shinyapps.io/Swans_Sonic_Youth/).
