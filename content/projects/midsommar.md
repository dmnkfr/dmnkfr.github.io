### Temperature and precipitation on midsummer* in Stockholm between 1860 and 2020.

Here's a visualization of the mean temperature across three measurements (morning, noon, evening) and precipitation in Stockholm on June 21st 1860-2020. Data from [SMHI](https://www.smhi.se/data). The code is [here.](https://github.com/dmnkfr/midsommar/blob/main/midsommar.R)

\* Until the 1950s midsummer was celebrated on June 23rd and thereafter on the Friday closest to June 21st. To ease things a bit, I used June 21st for the entire period in the plot.

### Glad Midsommar!
