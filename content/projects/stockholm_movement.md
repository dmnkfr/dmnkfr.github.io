### Using tidiverse and ggplot2 to illustrate how income inequality manifested during the COVID-19 pandemic

Out of curiosity, I wanted to replicate [a friend's analysis of transit data for London during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://inductivestep.github.io/Google-transit-London/) for the greater Stockholm region. However, just one plot in, it was obvious that the ability to work from home might strongly hinge on one's income situation. So I got some income data for Stockholm's municipalities and created a few plots that illustrate how inequality manifested during the pandemic.
