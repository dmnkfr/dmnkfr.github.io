title: About
---

I am a data scientist with a PhD in linguistics and experience as a researcher in cognitive neuroscience and psychometrics. I have a penchant for natural language processing and pretty visualizations.

When I am not lost in the realm of code, I surround myself with music and books, build guitar effect pedals or furniture, take photos on film, climb rock or plastic walls, get utterly exhausted running in the beautiful scenery of Stockholm, or lose myself hiking in the vast Swedish landscapes.
