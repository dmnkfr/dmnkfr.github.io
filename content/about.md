title: About
---

I am a data scientist with a PhD in linguistics and vast experience as a researcher in cognitive neuroscience and psychometrics. I have a penchant for natural language processing and pretty visualizations. I feel at home both in Python and R and am experienced with both language's data science tech stack.

When I am not lost in the realm of code, I surround myself with music and books, build guitar effect pedals and furniture, take photos on film, climb rock or plastic walls, or get utterly exhausted running in the beautiful scenery of Stockholm.
