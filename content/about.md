title: About
---

I am a data scientist with a PhD in linguistics and vast experience as a researcher in cognitive neuroscience and psychometrics. I use state-of-the-art programming, statistical, and machine learning methods to find meaning in data. I have a penchant for natural language processing and pretty visualisations.

__Tech stack:__ ___R:___ tidyverse, datatable, tidymodels, caret, keras, tensorflow, ggplot, shinyR, stringr, purr; ___Python:___ numpy, pandas, scikitlearn, matplotlib, seaborn, keras, tensorflow, NLTK; ___SQL___, ___git___.

When I am not lost in the realm of code, I surround myself with music and books, build guitar effect pedals and furniture, take photos on film, climb rock or plastic walls, or get utterly exhausted running in the beautiful scenery of Stockholm.
