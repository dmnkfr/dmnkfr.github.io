I am a data scientist with a PhD in linguistics and vast experience as a researcher cognitive neuroscience and psychometrics. I use state-of-the-art programming, statistical, and machine learning methods to find meaning in data (and make pretty plots).

### Experience
__Aug 2021 Data Science Fellow at Science to Data Science__

Science to Data Science (S2DS) is a highly selective and intensive 5-week program with the aim of facilitating academics to transition into data science.

During the program, I worked in a team of five on a project commissioned by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) on assessing the usefulness of social media to understand changes in behaviors and attitudes towards food during the 18 months of the covid pandemic.

The aim of the project was to identify the main themes and trends of conversations on social media around food and COVID-19. Using NLP and machine learning methods, we found that social media listening can be reliably used to observe consumer behaviours, which can be of great value to the client when responding to rapidly changing events.
