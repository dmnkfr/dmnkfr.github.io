### Experience
__Aug 2021 Data Science Fellow at Science to Data Science__

[Science to Data Science (S2DS)](https://s2ds.org/) is a highly selective and intensive 5-week program with the aim of facilitating academics to transition into data science.

During the program, I worked in a team of five on a project commissioned by the [Food Standards Agency (FSA)](https://www.food.gov.uk/) on assessing the usefulness of social media to understand changes in behaviors and attitudes towards food during the 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the project was to identify the main themes and trends of conversations on social media around food and COVID-19. 

- Using NLP and machine learning methods, we distilled the main trends from the data, allowing us to detect a valuable signal in (very very very) noisy data.
- We successfully delivered a proof-of-concept that social media listening can be reliably used to observe consumer behaviours in almost real-time, which can be of great value to the client when responding to rapidly changing events.


__2018-2021 Postdoctoral Researcher at Stockholm University:__

Conceptualization, design, implementation, conduction, analysis, and write-up of a large-scale combined behavioral and neuroimaging experiment on second language processing and representation in the brain.

- We published a review paper from this project in the top journal in the field of linguistics, [ _Applied Linguistics._ ](https://academic.oup.com/applij)
- I designed an R pipeline to process, analyse, and visualise electrical brain activation data.


__2017-2018 Postdoctoral Researcher at BIFIE (now IQS) Austria:__

Scientific backbone of a nation-wide UX-supported [language assessment and training tool](https://usbplus.at/) in close collaboration with highly heterogeneous stakeholders. Design, sampling, administration, and analysis for the validation and standard setting of the assessment and evaluation procedure.

- In a tense field of expectations and limitations, we successfully rolled out this tool, which is now used by thousands of teachers in Austria.
- In a series of seminars, I had the honour to introduce the field of linguistics and language development to hundreds of teachers.

__2016-2017 Lecturer (part-time) at University of Salzburg:__

Teaching undergraduate and graduate courses on experimental methods in
linguistics and on the neurolinguistic foundations of second language acquisition.

__2014 & 2015 Visiting Postgraduate Researcher at University of Edinburgh:__

Collaboration in an experiment on incremental language comprehension in a thriving lab environment.

__2011-2015 Doctoral Researcher at University of Salzburg:__

Conceptualization, design, implementation, conduction, analysis, and write-
up of a number of electrophysiological and behavioural experiments on predictive and semantic sentence processing in a first and second language.

### Formal Education
